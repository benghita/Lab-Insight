Diagnosis of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is defined as abnormalities of kidney structure or function, present for 
longer than 3 months, with implications for health . 
The most recent Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guidelines (2012) recommended that CKD should be classified using the CGA staging system . This includes 
Cause, Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) category and Albuminuria category (as marker for kidney damage), as the combination of these factors relates to risks of adverse outcomes . 
Criteria for CKD : Either of the following present for more than 3 months
1.  Decreased GFR (<60 ml/min/1.73 m
2) (GFR categories G3a-G5)
2.  Markers of kidney damage  (one or more):
a. Albuminuria: Albumin excretion rate (AER) ≥30 mg/day or albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR)  
≥3 mg/mmol .
b. Urine sediment abnormalities (e .g. haematuria, red cell / white cell / granular casts, etc).
c. Electrolyte and other abnormalities due to tubular disorders .
d. Abnormalities detected by histology .
e. Structural abnormalities detected by imaging .
f. History of kidney transplantation . 
Classification of CKD using the CGA system
Previous CKD guidelines included only the level of GFR for staging . By using the CGA system, the 
cause and albuminuria category are also used . CKD is not a disease in itself, and the assignment of 
cause is important for determination of prognosis and to guide treatment decisions .
1. Assignment of the cause of CKD
The cause of CKD is assigned based on the presence or absence of systemic disease and the location of observed or assumed pathology within the kidney . In developed countries, hypertension 
and diabetes are the most frequent causes of CKD . Examples are supplied in Table 1.Guide to laboratory tests  |  4

2. Recommendations regarding GFR estimation
• Since November 2014 Ampath is using the 2009 CKD – EPI creatinine equation.
• The main advantages of using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration  (CKD – EPI) equation are the following:
• More accurate at GFR >60 ml/min/1.73 m² and GFR >90 ml/min/1.73 m² is reportable using CKD – EPI equation .
• Less influenced by ethnic origin and reasonable to use without correction for race and ethnicity .5  |  Ampath Desk Reference
• Significant reclassification from stage 3a (GFR 45 – 59) to stage 2 (GFR 60 – 89).
• CKD – EPI classification shows better accuracy compared to gold standard methods of  
GFR estimation than MDRD, especially at high GFRs, in younger people and women .
• Validated in older people . 
• Limitations of serum creatinine (SCr) as a marker are still applicable – see Table 2.
Table 2: Sources of error in GFR estimation using creatinine 
Source of error Example
Non-steady state • Acute kidney injury (AKI)
Non-GFR determinants of SCr that differ from study 
populations in which equations were developed
• Factors affecting creatinine generation • Race / ethnicity other than US / European 
black and white
• Extremes of muscle mass or body size
• Diet and nutritional status (high protein diet /creatine supplements / ingestion of  
cooked meats)
• Muscle wasting diseases
• Factors affecting tubular secretion of creatinine • Decreased by drug-induced inhibition: trimethoprim, cimetidine, fenofibrate
• Factors affecting extra-renal elimination of creatinine• Dialysis
• Decreased by inhibition of gut creatininase by antibiotics
• Increased by large volume losses of extracellular fluidsGuide to laboratory tests  |  6
Source of error Example
Higher GFR • Higher measurement error in low SCr and 
high GFR
Interference with creatinine assay • Spectral interferences (e .g. bilirubin, some 
drugs)
• Chemical interferences (e .g. glucose, 
ketones, bilirubin, some drugs)
• GFR categories in CKD: Please take note that the previously used Stage 3 has been subdivided into stages 3a and 3b, based on data supporting different risks and outcomes . Although some 
decline in GFR is expected with aging, a value below 60 ml/min/1.73 m
2 is also regarded as 
decreased .

(ml/min/1.73 m2)Terms
G1 ≥90 Normal or high
G2 60 – 89 Mildly decreased*
G3a 45 – 59 Mildly to moderately decreased
G3b 30 – 44 Moderately to severely decreased
G4 15 – 29 Severely decreased
G5 <15 Kidney failure
*Relative to young adult level                Kidney International Supplements 2013: 3:19-62
• In the absence of evidence of kidney damage, neither GFR category G1 nor G2 fulfil the  
criteria for CKD .
• eGFR from 60 to 89 is mildly decreased and not regarded as CKD unless present for longer than 3 months in the presence of moderate albuminuria (>3.0 mg/mmol). Associated risk factors 7  |  Ampath Desk Reference
for cardiovascular disease, including hypertension, dyslipidaemia, smoking and other lifestyle 
factors, should be addressed . 
The following additional investigations are recommended:
• Creatinine: repeat within 14 days for confirmation (after 12 hours of no meat consumption), and then annually .
• Annual urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio .
3. Albuminuria as a marker of kidney damage:
• Albuminuria is the preferred marker for assessment of kidney damage, and should be used in preference to proteinuria, as it is the earliest marker of glomerular diseases. There is a graded increase in risk for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, kidney failure, acute kidney injury (AKI) and CKD progression for higher albuminuria categories across all GFR categories .
• For screening purposes, an early-morning urine sample (first pass) for determination of the albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) is preferred .
• The term microalbuminuria used for an ACR of 3 – 30 mg/mmol (category A2) should no longer be used and has been replaced by the term “moderately increased” albuminuria .
• An abnormal screening test should be confirmed by an ACR on an early-morning urine sample 
or an albumin excretion rate (AER) in a timed urine collection .
• The use of reagent test strips are discouraged due to poor sensitivity at lower concentrations 
and because the values are not adjusted for urinary concentration .
• If non-albuminuric proteinuria is suspected, use assays for specific proteins, e .g. determination of 
Bence Jones proteins in myeloma patients .Guide to laboratory tests  |  8

Areas of controversy or confusion 
CKD with isolated GFR decrease without markers of kidney damage may be seen with heart failure, 
liver cirrhosis, hypothyroidism, malnutrition and in kidney donors .
CKD with isolated persistent albuminuria  without decreased GFR is seen in obesity and the 
metabolic syndrome . CKD should be excluded in patients with orthostatic (postural) proteinuria with 
PER >1000 mg/24h .9  |  Ampath Desk Reference

0.06 – 0.49 ng/ml May indicate:
- no or minor systemic inflammatory response .
- local inflammation .
- chronic inflammatory processes .

- viral infections .
- mild to moderate localised bacterial infections .
0.5 – 1.99 ng/ml Possible bacterial infection . 
Non bacterial causes (such as invasive fungal infections, viral 
infections, severe trauma, major surgery, burns, cardiogenic

It is important to note that PCT levels below 0.5 ng/ml do not always indicate the absence of 
bacterial infection . Falsely low PCT levels may occur in the presence of bacterial infections e .g.:
• in the early course of localised infections and sub-acute infective endocarditis
• if PCT done very early following onset of a systemic bacterial infection (usually <6 hours)
In the above cases, PCT should be re-assessed 6 – 24 hours later .

Diagnosis and classification of Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) in the emergency department setting
• A sensitive cardiac troponin  (TnT / TnI) is the  preferred biochemical marker for diagnosis of AMI, 
replacing previously used biomarkers such as myoglobin and CK-MB .
• CK-MB is an acceptable alternative only when troponin is not available .
• The 99th percentile of a reference population is used as upper limit of normal for troponin testing .
• The diagnosis of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)  is made by typical ECG findings 
in patients with a suggestive clinical presentation, and not by elevation of troponins . Treatment 
must be initiated immediately and not delayed until Troponin results are available . 
• Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)  is confirmed by a  troponin above the  
rule-in level (>100 ng/l for hsTnT).21  |  Ampath Desk Reference
• Troponin results above the 99th percentile but below the MI-rule in level, should be repeated 
after 3 hours to show a significant change for diagnosis of acute mycardial damage / AMI in a 
setting of ischaemia (recent onset chest pain / ECG-changes). 
• A significant change for hsTnT is regarded as a 50% increase for values from 15 – 52 ng/l or 20% increase for values from 53 – 100 ng/l in a follow up sample . A 50% change should be 
regarded as significant in the case of Troponin I .
• NSTEMI is excluded after 2 measurements taken at least 3 hours apart that remain negative or show an insignificant change or if a value reliably 6 hours following the onset of chest pain is negative .
• A stable increase in troponin level (hsTnT 15 – 100 with insignificant % change) could be due to congestive cardiac failure (CCF), severe hypertension, haemodynamic shock, pulmonary embolism, myocarditis, cardiac trauma and sepsis .

Diabetes Mellitus (DM) (two abnormal values confirm diagnosis)≥7.0 And / or ≥11.1 And	/	or	≥6.5
• An HbA1c of 6.5% is recommended as the cut point for diagnosing diabetes . An HbA1c value less 
than 6.5% does not exclude diabetes if glucose values are within the diabetic range .
• In an asymptomatic person the diagnosis should not be based on a single abnormal glucose or 
HbA1c result, but should be confirmed by at least one additional HbA1c or plasma glucose in the diabetic range, either fasting, random or 2 hours following an oral 75 g glucose load (OGTT).  Guide to laboratory tests  |  28
• Important conditions to adhere to before performing the OGTT are ingestion of at least 150 g of dietary 
carbohydrate per day for 3 days prior to the test, a 10 to 16 hour fast, and commencement of the test between 7 am and 9 am .
• The use of blood glucose monitoring meters and non-laboratory HbA1c methods for diagnosis of diabetes is discouraged.

Gestational Diabetes Mellitus  
(one abnormal value confirms the 
diagnosis at any gestation)5.1 – 6.9 ≥10.0 8.5 – 11.0
Hyperglycaemia detected at any time during pregnancy should be classified as either:
• Diabetes mellitus in pregnancy 
• Gestational DM in pregnancy  
NB: The use of the 50 g and 100 g OGTT tests have been abandoned in favour of the 75 g OGTT .
Guidelines for use of HbA1c levels to diagnose DM in pregnancy are not yet established .29  |  Ampath Desk Reference
Factors influencing HbA1c measurement (consider when HbA1c and glucose results are discrepant)
Increased HbA1c Decreased HbA1c
Erythropoiesis Iron deficiency, vitamin 
B12 deficiency, decreased 
erythropoiesisAdministration of iron, B12 or erythropoietin, 
reticulocytosis, chronic liver disease
Altered haemoglobinHaemoglobin variants do not directly cross-react with assays used, but lead to decreased erythrocyte lifespan, HbF is often measured as part of total Hb  
Erythrocyte destructionIncreased erythrocyte lifespan: SplenectomyDecreased erythrocyte life span: Haemoglobinopathies, haemolytic anaemia or other causes of haemolysis e .g.splenomegaly or 
malaria, RA or drugs (antiretrovirals, ribavirin and dapsone)
Glycation Alcoholism, chronic renal failureAspirin, vitamin C and E, certain haemoglobinopathies, increased intra-erythrocyte pH
HbA1c targets for glycaemic control:
• The optimal HbA1c target for the majority of diabetic patients is 7.0% tested at 6 monthly intervals.
• A lower HbA1c target of 6.5% is advocated for younger, newly diagnosed patients at low risk for CVD .
• A higher HbA1c target of 7.5% is applicable to the elderly, patients at high risk for CVD, those with poor 
short-term prognosis or hypoglycaemic unawareness .
• Although HbA1c may not be used for diagnosis of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus, it can be used for 
monitoring treatment with a lower target level of 6%.  Guide to laboratory tests  |  30

• In the earlier stages of haemochromatosis, the percentage transferrin saturation may be increased 
with a normal ferritin .  
• Haemochromatosis PCR is available if haemochromatosis is suspected .
• Ferritin is a positive acute-phase protein . 
• In the presence of an acute-phase response a ferritin level below 50 ng/ml is regarded as an indication of depleted iron stores, whereas a level >100 ng/ml excludes iron deficiency . 
• A soluble transferrin receptor determination is recommended for ferritin levels between  
50 ng/ml and 100 ng/ml to help distinguish between iron deficiency (increased) and an  
iron transfer block due to inflammation / chronic disease (normal).
